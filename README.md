# 🚧 Limitations

📺 No Actual Video Streaming
The project uses placeholder routes (e.g., /player/:id) and can only simulate video playback. Real Netflix-level streaming is not implemented.

🌐 Google OAuth Dependency
While Google login is integrated, the authentication process relies entirely on Google’s API. If the API fails or the internet connection is unstable, users cannot log in. Additionally, no fallback authentication mechanism is provided.

👤 No Multi-User Profiles
Unlike Netflix, this project does not support multiple user profiles under a single account, limiting personalized experiences.

📶 Limited Offline Support
Content cannot be downloaded for offline usage, and caching is not implemented, restricting access in low or no internet connectivity scenarios.

🗂️ Static Content
Movies and TV shows are either hardcoded or fetched from demo APIs. The system does not provide dynamic content updates or personalized recommendations based on watch history.

⚡ Scalability Limitations
The project lacks backend server infrastructure or cloud support, which limits its ability to handle a large number of concurrent users.

⚖️ Legal and Copyright Constraints
Due to copyright restrictions, real Netflix content cannot be integrated. Only demo content or open APIs are used, limiting the variety and quality of available media.
